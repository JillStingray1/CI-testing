Example of automated testing using Github Actions. The Action is in the ./.github/c-cpp.yml. We use the config.sh to setup a basic testing environment, and make actions to build and test our project. 
The test.c file gives an example of unit testing, other libraries like CUnit can be used in place of making your own tests as well.
